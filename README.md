# Build-an-Arithmetic-Formatter-Project-freeCodeCamp-Python

A Python take on freeCodeCamp’s Arithmetic Formatter challenge.  Clean layout, smart validation, and a touch of elegance in every line.   Built to sharpen logic, formatting skills, and code clarity.
This project is one of the five required projects in the Scientific Computing with Python certification from freeCodeCamp. Completing it is part of the journey toward mastering Python fundamentals and earning the certification.

**Built as part of my journey through freeCodeCamp’s Python track.**
**Focused on clean code, logic structuring, and string manipulation.**

##🧠What You’ll Need to Know

To build this project successfully, you should be familiar with:

-🧮 Variables — assigning and using data in Python
-📦 Lists — storing, accessing, and iterating over collections
-✂️ String manipulation — slicing, formatting, and aligning text

## Example Input

["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"]

## Example Output

   32      3801      45      123  
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49  
-----    ------    ----    -----
